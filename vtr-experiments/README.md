# VTR Experiments

Put your experiment stuff here once you figure out how VTR works.

## Folders

- `benchmarks/` - Verilog files to run
- `architectures/` - FPGA architecture XML files  
- `results/` - Output from experiments
- `scripts/` - Any scripts you write

## How to run VTR (once installed)

```bash
cd /path/to/vtr-verilog-to-routing

./vtr_flow/scripts/run_vtr_flow.py \
    path/to/circuit.v \
    path/to/architecture.xml
```

## Notes
- (add notes as you learn)
